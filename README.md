# 🌐 Gazara | Full Project

### 🧩 Overview
This project showcases a collaborative QA effort within an Agile environment, where our team worked through multiple sprints to build and test the Gazara platform from the ground up.
Starting from the user stories and epics, we designed detailed test cases, scenarios, and test plans aligned with product goals and sprint priorities.
Using Jira as our project management tool, we tracked progress, logged defects, and ensured continuous quality delivery through iterative sprint reviews and QA validations.
The result reflects a well-structured, cross-functional QA process integrating planning, execution, and reporting — all following Agile testing best practices.
The project demonstrates complete **test lifecycle management** from requirement analysis to execution.
